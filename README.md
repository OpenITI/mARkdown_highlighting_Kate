# Installing the OpenITI mARkdown Highlighting schema for Kate editor

## On Mac:

1. Unzip the zip file
2. Open the unzipped folder in Finder, and double-click `install_on_mac.command`. This will install the OpenITImARkdown.xml file in the folder `$HOME/Library/Application Support/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax`
3. Close Kate and (re-)open it. The OpenITImARkdown highlighting scheme should now be visible in Kate's menu: Tools > Highlighting > Markup
4. You can test whether it worked by opening the tags_test.mARkdown file in Kate; you should see the highlighting schema in action. 

## On Windows

1. Unzip the zip file
2. Open the unzipped folder in Explorer, and double-click `install_on_windows.bat`. This will install the OpenITImARkdown.xml file in the folder `%LocalAppData%/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax`
3. Close Kate and (re-)open it. The OpenITImARkdown highlighting scheme should now be visible in Kate's menu: Tools > Highlighting > Markup
4. You can test whether it worked by opening the tags_test.mARkdown file in Kate; you should see the highlighting schema in action.
